# When does MicroCenter get stock of RTX/Ryzen/Radeon?
- First off, don't bother with weekends. There has only been 1 recorded weekend shipment and it was suspected to be a delayed black friday truck.
- Mondays and Thursdays are guaranteed to have trucks, but because of this, are the hardest days to camp. People show up at anywhere from 9-12 hours before just to ensure they have an early spot in line for these days. PLEASE NOTE THAT A TRUCK DOES NOT MEAN THEY WILL HAVE THE CARD/PROCESSOR YOU WANT!
- Wednesdays and Fridays are a better middle ground because there may not be a truck, but less people camp. 
- Tuesdays, in my experience are the worst days, but that also means the least amount of people will camp these days if you want to gamble.


# How much stock are on these trucks?
- LET ME REITERATE: A GUARANTEED TRUCK DOES NOT MEAN GUARANTEED STOCK. With so many different products that different people want, there could be a truck, but the shipment may not contain the component you're looking for. I camped on truck days where no stock was present, and other people have camped overnight for a truck that only had 3060ti's, despite wanting a 3080. In terms of how many units, quantity varies greatly. Some trucks have as little as 2 x 3080s, and others have as many as 50 x 3080. Be prepared to roll the dice.

# Do they ever get mid day shipments?
Occasionally yes. Which days they actually arrive seems to still be a mystery but they tend to arrive 11am-noon ish if at all.

 
# What time should I show up?
 People tend to arrive in waves. If there are any psycho's, they're bound to show up at like 3-4am. Another wave tends to arrive at 5:30-6am. After that, there's a constant trickle from about 6:45 until opening at 9am. For a while I showed up consistently at 6am and was anywhere from 1st to 12th (though typically first 5) but lately people have started camping much earlier to beat out competition.

# Any tips for doing this campout thing?
- As the weather gets colder, and camping becomes literally more dangerous, PLEASE remain conscious of both the risks of covid, as well the cold weather. 
- No matter how much you layer up, your body might be warm but your toes and fingers will get frozen regardless. Invest in some hand/toe warmers. 
- Pick your fights! camping every day is not only going to raise your statistics of L's, it'll also take a toll on your sleep schedule and physical (and honestly mental) health
- With this in mind, I would wake up such that getting ready and leaving asap will land you at MC parking lot at around 5-5:30 am. This means if you live an hour away you might be waking up at 4am.
- Upon waking up, check the discord! people are very active here, and anyone who happens to be in line already will be happy to update on whether a truck is out back, and how many people are in line so far. 
- Generally, if there are 15 people or less, I'd race to the store as soon as you can, but if there are 20 or more, I would sleep in and prepare for another day. If between 15 and 20, flip a coin. 
- Bring a chair! Sitting on the ground is going to freeze your ass literally, and be way less comfortable.
- Random pro tip: Go straight from your car to the line without grabbing your stuff. Say hi to the people there, establish a presence and your place in line. After they acknowledge you, they'll be happy to let you run back to your car to grab your stuff, but if you grab stuff first, someone might swoop your spot.
- Make friends! So many of the people I've met through the discord and camping have been very friendly people and have both made the wait more bearable, and even have helped me get some of my most desired products! Your connections could go a long long way!

# Are we allowed to wait in our cars?
- currently, no. too many people who aren't in the discord or are uncooperative make such a system difficult to implement without help of micro center themselves. As long as you establish a presence in line with the people next to you, they're most likely going to be okay rotating 30 min car breaks or something similar. Generally people are friendly so long as you have an honest vibe and they have no reason to be suspicious. This also applies to stuff like bringing your chair back to your car, or grabbing extra blankets, etc.

# Whats the deal with bathrooms?
- Starbucks doesn't allow anyone to use their restrooms. The first hour of Trader Joes opening time is for seniors - they ask not to use it during that time. Otherwise the toilet in Trader Joes is right at the back of the store. Go in, go to the back, turn right and there it is. The lastest time Trader Joe's will allow anyone to use the restroom is 10 PM. The best bet for the early mornings is the Dunkins a block down. First opportunity is at 4:30 when Dunkins opens.
 
# How does it work once the clock hits 9am?
- They'll unlock the front doors, and let people in one at a time. Once you get in, you'll get your hands sprayed with sanitizer and be directed to a sales associate, who will ask you what you're looking for. There will be a stack of printer paper on the table in the front that act as vouchers for a single unit of product, which will be handed to you if what you're looking for is in stock that day. You will be limited to one GPU and one CPU per day. They'll spew some stuff about warranty and aggressively push you towards checkout but you're welcome to ask to do some additional shopping. All of the worthwhile product is kept behind the registers and is given to you once you check out.

- "Hey guys, i see a lot of questions of "was there stock on this day & what did they have". Here's a Google form to collect data https://forms.gle/WxMUXizjKWdbe7A3A add to it if you at the store and find out about stock, and link to look at the data https://bit.ly/3m0bwt6. When I'm not lazy I'll add some analysis charts (e.g. stock for each day of the week), to help people decide if they want to camp. I've added a few days when I lined up."
