- 1 item of each category, per customer. You cant have multiple cards or multiple processors. You decide what you want. 
- Micro Center has the "1 card, per customer, per 30 day" rule. Dont bother asking how to bypass this, you'll get muted.

# How do I go about getting a graphics card then?
## Courtesy of @boxer#7326 as he has acquired key knowledge from MC directly:

**ABSOLUTELY** no camping is permitted on Micro Center property. No line forming is allowed unless instructed to do so by a Cambridge Micro Center Associate. This process helps everyone out as you no longer need to camp for 12 hours for a graphics card.

##### What you will need:
> - Government issued Identification card
> - Cell phone with QR scanning ability/app _**with**_ internet access and your cell phone number
> - Form of payment (Cash, credit card, etc)
> - Patience

How do I register for the Micro Center shuffle:
> - 1 hour before Micro Center openning, a randomly-generated QR code (generated that day) will be posted outside the store along with the list of cards by series and quantities available that morning on a sandwich board. (eg. 3070 x 10, 3080ti x 4, etc)
> - If you are interested in any card that is available, you will need to scan the QR code and navigate to the registration site. Please note that you will enter a lottery for a general pool and not a specific card.
> - Do not form lines and do not congregate by the entrance or by the posters with the QR code. Make it easier for everyone there and the Micro Center staff
> - No line forming is allowed unless instructed to do so by a Cambridge Micro Center Associate.
> - Register yourself with the following information:
>   - Submit all information that the form is requesting with absolute accuracy. First and Last Name as it appears on your ID, Cell Phone number, and ID Number. 

What happens after registration:
> - The registration website site will close 30 minutes prior to openning
> - You are only given the 30 minute time window to register
> - Immediately upon the closure of registration, randomly selected customers will be notified by "Text Message" that they are given a chance to purchase a card. 
> - Notifications are expected to occur throughout the 30 minutes before Micro Center opens
>   - Its usually best recommended to stay a few minutes after open since some people may have left or the GPU they wanted is now out of stock. 
> - Selected individuals will be instructed to come to the door WITHIN 10 minutes for ID Verification
> - Your ID will be verified and purchase history checked to ensure the 30 day cooldown period is enforced. 
> - If your name is drawn but you do not purchase a card it will not impact your standing with regards to the 30-day rule

What happens when I am picked:
> - There will be two ID checks
>   - Outside: to ensure that the registered person is physically present 
>   - Inside: to ensure that the same person is purchasing the card. The Person who won the raffle will have to be the person in-line making a purchase at the register.
> - A Micro Center employee will direct you to form a line

Please note that the following actions will result in permanent black listing:
> - Creating multiple entries by utilizing multiple Phone Numbers/IDs/Variation in name spelling
> - Creating registrations for Customers not physically present
> - Switching place with someone else if your name is drawn
> - Using fake IDs
> - Failure to comply with directions with regards to congregation/line forming
> - Any other attempts to ‚Äúgame‚Äù the system.

# Im STILL confused, draw me a scenario:

Lets say there are 30 cards available, 10x3080, 5x3070, 5x3090, 10x3080Ti. Micro Center will then RANDOMLY select 30 people who have registered. These people could be a mix of people chosen who signed up at various times. Just because you signed up as soon as the QR code is released DOES NOT mean you have a better chance. 

Lets say you win, you'll then get a Text Message notification that you've won the chance to buy a GPU. Lets say everyone ahead of you ends up getting the card you REALLY wanted. You can repeat this registration process on other days until you get the GPU you want, without the need to camp EVERY. DAMN. NIGHT. Please, please, please, dont buy a GPU for the sake of buying a GPU. There are other people trying to get GPUs. Keep in mind that if you do buy one, you will then start your 30 day cool-down, or whatever process Micro Center has in place to prevent GPU hoarding. 

By going with this method, the most important thing I want to iterate is that everyone has an equal chance to get a GPU, as long as they register in time. This method does not guarantee that you'll get the specific GPU that you want so badly, hence the part that says "If your name is drawn but you do not purchase a card it will not impact your standing with regards to the 30-day rule". This means that you can register, win the lottery to be a GPU customer, but still leave with nothing, assuming you wanted X card but they didn't have X card available. 

Final Point:
- Absolutely no sharing the QR code for that day. This is inclusive to both in and out of this Discord server (DMs, social media forums, etc). If you are caught doing this, moderation may take place. Please make it fair for EVERYONE

# Who can I contact if I have heard people talk about scalping. What if I got a DM of someone trying to scalp to me?
- We cannot move forward with any moderation without proof. So verbal comments aren't enough for us to work with
- Please DM me as I am the most active Moderator of this Micro Center. If I don't respond within a few hours, reach out to any of our Community Leaders @boxer#7326, @Eepers#9822,or @Gonginator#5294. If all else fails to reply, submit a Mod Mail or DM another mod. 

# For everyone who doesn't know what MSRP + Tax is for anything, purely based off of the GPUs that MC sells, feels free to use this Google Sheet that I made.
