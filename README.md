# **Common Questions**
#### 1️⃣ What are the store hours?
- Store hours can be located here: https://www.microcenter.com/site/stores/cambridge.aspx

#### 2️⃣ When does Micro Center get new GPU/CPU stock
- Trucks **NEVER** guarantee a GPU drop. Lets get that straight. Trucks typically arrive on Mondays and Thursdays. 

#### 3️⃣ How much stock are on these trucks?
- LET ME REITERATE: **A TRUCK DOES NOT MEAN GUARANTEED STOCK**. It could be as little as 0 GPUs to a whole pallet full. No one knows for sure.

#### 4️⃣ Do they ever get mid day shipments?
- Very random. Which days they actually arrive seems to still be a mystery but they tend to arrive 11AM EST to noon-ish if at all.

#### 5️⃣ How often does Micro Center carry _**X**_ product?
- No one knows for certain. At this point it is completely random. Its best to check https://www.microcenter.com/ for inventory prior to visiting.

#### 6️⃣ Is Micro Center scalping/upcharging for GPUs?
- No. Prices are MSRP. Micro Center is not scalping.

#### 7️⃣ Does a Micro Center employee know the stock of the trucks? Can I ask them?
- Micro Center employees don't know the stock of the trucks the day before. Please do not harrass them

#### 8️⃣ How many graphics cards and processors can I walk out of the store with?
- 1 item of each category, per customer. You can't have multiple cards or multiple processors. You decide what you want. 
- Micro Center has the "1 card, per customer, per 30 day" rule. Dont bother asking how to bypass this, you'll get muted. 
  - "**_I had my friend buy for me_**"/"**_My family member bought it for me!_**"/"**_I used a different address when buying_**" are all types of circumvention and you will banned for this.  

#### 9️⃣ Can I trust Ricky?
- Ricky is an enigma. He back and revived. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44854412/143808797-167837e3-9a61-4e69-ac94-9a862c202c68.png)

# How do I go about getting a graphics card then?
As of 3/2/22, Micro Center is no longer requiring customers to enter any form of a "shuffle" or "raffle" system to purchase a GPU.
