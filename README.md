# Archived 6/16-11/28 FAQ
----------

THIS IS THE MOST RECENTLY UPDATED FAQ AS OF 6/16. THE ABOVE INFORMATION IS OLDER INFORMATION. PLEASE FOLLOW THE FAQ BELOW.

Welcome!!!!
Please, please, PLEASE read the FAQs. I cannot stress this enough. These are by far the most common questions and giving this a read will 99% answer your question. Please refrain from asking the same question as many other people when this FAQ is an excellent way for you to make YOUR OWN JUDGEMENT. Use the FAQ for guidance. 

# What are the different channels for?

- üí¨-ma-general-chat - Used for general, every day chatter
- üêÄ-ma-strix-corner - Originally used for those who are camping at Micro Center. Given there is no more camping, this is used for morning discussions for those who may or may not have won the random lottery to become a GPU customer. Also used as General 2
- üì¶-ma-stock-alerts -  STRICTLY used for notifying the Cambridge community of all known levels of stock for highly sought after products.  Individuals from üêÄ-ma-strix-corner who are pretty much lined up at MC should post here of what was in stock.

# When does Micro Center get new GPU/CPU Stock
- No truck will ever GUARANTEE that there will be any of the above mentioned stock. There have been days with a bunch of stock, and days without any stock. Truck days are TYPICALLY a good sign that there's a better chance of something being in stock. 
- The following days are community known days to have the best chance of getting said items: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and most recently Friday. Tuesdays and the weekends have been known to have a near 0% chance of getting any of the items.
- Again, A TRUCK DOES NOT MEAN THEY WILL HAVE THE CARD/PROCESSORS.


# How much stock are on these trucks?
- LET ME REITERATE: A GUARANTEED TRUCK DOES NOT MEAN GUARANTEED STOCK. With so many different products that different people want, there could be a truck, but the shipment may not contain the component you're looking for. We're fortunate enough that Cambridge Micro Center has now implemented a QR system to let everyone know what stock they will have for that morning. Some trucks have as little as 2 x 3080s, and others have as many as 50 x 3080 (ahh the legendary Dec. 23 drop). Be prepared to roll the dice.

# Do they ever get mid day shipments?
- Occasionally yes. Which days they actually arrive seems to still be a mystery but they tend to arrive 11am-noon-ish if at all. 


# Does a Micro Center employee know the stock of the trucks? Can I ask them?
- Micro Center employees don't know the stock of the trucks the day before. Whoever is working in the morning will know, but by that time, stock will be gone before you ask.

# How do I go about getting a graphics card then?
Courtesy of @boxer#7326 as he has acquired key knowledge from MC directly:

- In order to better allocate the constrained supply of the highly sought-after GPUs we will be implementing a new allocation system. Effective Wednesday June 16, 2021 no camping is permitted on Micro Center property. No line forming is allowed unless instructed to do so by a Cambridge Micro Center Associate
- Starting Thursday June 17th:

> - At 9:00 AM a randomly-generated QR code (generated that day) will be posted outside the store along with the list of cards by series and quantities available that morning. (eg. 3070 x 10, 3080ti x 4, etc)
> - If you are interested in the card that is available, you will need to scan the QR code and navigate to the registration site. Please note that you will enter a lottery for a general pool and not a specific card.
> - You will need to go back to your vehicle. Do not form lines and do not congregate by the posters with the QR code. Failure to comply with this rule will result in forfeiture.
> - No line forming is allowed unless instructed to do so by a Cambridge Micro Center Associate.
> - In the comfort of your vehicle, register yourself with the following information:
> - First and Last Name as it appears on your ID
> - Cell Phone number.
> - ID Number. 

- A valid State-Issued Drivers License/Identification Card must be presented.
- The registration site will close at 9:30 AM
- You have the same chance to purchase a card if you register at 9:00 AM or at 9:29 AM
> - Immediately upon the closure of registration, randomly selected customers will be notified by Text Message that they secured a chance to purchase a card. 
> - Notifications are expected to occur between 9:35 AM and 10 AM.
> - Selected individuals will be instructed to come to the door WITHIN 10 minutes for ID Verification
> - Your ID will be verified and purchase history checked to ensure the 30 day cooldown period is enforced. 
> - If your name is drawn but you do not purchase a card it will not impact your standing with regards to the 30-day rule

- Please note that, there will be two ID checks
> - Outside: to ensure that the registered person is physically present 
> - Inside: to ensure that the same person is purchasing the card. The Person who won the raffle will have to be the person in-line making a purchase at the register.

Please note that the following actions will result in permanent black listing:
> - Creating multiple entries by utilizing multiple Phone Numbers/IDs/Variation in Name spelling
> - Creating registrations for Customers not physically present
> - Switching place with someone else if your name is drawn
> - Using fake IDs
> - Failure to comply with directions with regards to congregation/line forming
> - Any other attempts to ‚Äúgame‚Äù the system.

# What does this mean and how does it look like:

Lets say there are 30 cards available, 10x3080, 5x3070, 5x3090, 10x3080Ti. Micro Center will then RANDOMLY select 30 people. These people could be a mix of people chosen who signed up at various times, 9:06AM, 9:14AM, 9:29AM, etc. Just because you signed up at 9AM on the dot DOES NOT mean you have a better chance. 

Lets say you win, you'll then get a notification that you've won the chance to buy a GPU. You're number 11. As the other 10 customers ahead of you buy up the 3080s, you're presented with either 3070s, 3090s, or 3080Ti's. You can decline if you ONLY wanted a 3080. You can repeat this process until you get the GPU you want, without the need to camp EVERY. DAMN. NIGHT. Please, please, please, dont buy a GPU for the sake of buying a GPU. There are plenty of people taking a swing for a chance to purchase one. Keep in mind that if you do buy one, you will then start your 30 day cool-down, or whatever process Micro Center has in place to prevent GPU hoarding. 

This new system that our Micro Center has implemented is to make things a little easier for people to try for a chance to get a GPU. By going with this method, the most important thing I want to iterate is that no matter what time you show up between 9AM and 9:30AM, everyone has an equal chance to get a GPU. This method does not guarantee that you'll get the specific GPU that you want so badly, hence the part that says "If your name is drawn but you do not purchase a card it will not impact your standing with regards to the 30-day rule". This means that you can register, win the lottery to be a GPU customer, but still leave with nothing assuming you wanted X card but they didn't have X card available. 

This is a very new process and we don't expect everyone to understand this process 100% since we've always known that camping is the only way. Please read this over as much as you can to better understand this process. 

Key takeaways from this:
- There is absolutely no more camping. Like... never. If you do camp, you run the risk of getting blacklisted and you wont be able eligible for future entries
- You NEED to be present in order for you to sign up, hence the ID Checks, text message notifications, etc. 
- Absolutely no sharing the QR code for that day. This is inclusive to both in and out of this Discord server (DMs, social media forums, etc). If you are caught doing this, moderation may take place. Please make it fair for EVERYONE.

# How many graphics cards and processors can I walk out of the store with?
- 1 item of each category, per customer. You cant have multiple cards or multiple processors. You decide what you want. 
- Micro Center's across the US have now started to implement the "1 card, per customer, per 30 day" rule and some have even gone as far as implementing "1 card per household" rule to combat scalpers. Our particular Micro Center has the "1 card, per customer, per 30 day" rule. If you attempt to break any of these rules that the Cambridge Micro Center has in place, and they tell you they will not sell the product to you, that's that. There's nothing that us as a Discord server can do to help you. Do not talk about trying to circumvent this.  If you're caught doing this, you'll be banned. 

# Dude, I'm in front of Micro Center and I see a rat?! WTF?!
- That's the local Micro Center rat. Oh, and he's our mascot, Strix. He do be chillin doe üò≥ üêÄ 
- Throwback when Strix was #1 in line: https://discord.com/channels/758857077531213855/826818885599625327/829692659965755403

# Can I trust Ricky?
- Ricky is an enigma. He back and revived. :FeelsGoodMan: 

# Who can I contact if I have heard people talk about scalping. What if I got a DM of someone trying to scalp to me?
- We cannot move forward with any moderation without proof. So verbal comments aren't enough for us to work with
- Please DM me as I am the most active Moderator of this Micro Center. If I don't respond within a few hours, reach out to any of our Community Leaders @boxer#7326, @Eepers#9822, @Gonginator#5294, or @tefla#0264. If all else fails to reply, submit a Mod Mail or DM another mod. 

# For everyone who doesn't know what MSRP + Tax is for anything, purely based off of the GPUs that MC sells, feels free to use this Google Sheet that I made.
